## Description
This project enhances a fully functional Tech Quiz application by adding comprehensive testing using Cypress. The Tech Quiz app is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and allows users to take a quiz consisting of ten random tech-related questions and view their final score.

The primary goal of this project is to ensure the reliability and robustness of the application by implementing both component and end-to-end tests using Cypress.
